## SlidingPuzzle

The sliding puzzle problem â€“ solving techniques: BFS

For a given puzzle of n x n squares with numbers from 1 to (n x n-1) (one square is
empty) in an initial configuration, find a sequence of movements for the numbers in order to
reach a final given configuration, knowing that a number can move (horizontally or vertically) on
an adjacent empty square.


**EG:**

n = 3

**Initial State**

1 2 3

4 0 8

5 6 7

**Final State**

1 0 3

4 2 8

5 6 7
